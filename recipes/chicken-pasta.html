        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cook this creamy cajun chicken pasta in one pot on a busy week night to save on time and money with this easy recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Seasoning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pasta</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1/2 lb. penne pasta (uncooked)</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.
            </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.
            </li>
            <li>Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to saut√© for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.
            </li>
        </ol>
